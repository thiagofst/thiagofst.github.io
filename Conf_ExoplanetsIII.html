          <p><b>Abstract</b><br>

            It's not a mystery anymore the existence of planets orbiting different stars from our Sun. 
            The detection and future characterisation of the so-called extrasolar planets, also known as exoplanets, 
            is one of the main objectives of the VISTA Variables in the Vía Láctea Survey (VVV) and the VVV eXtended (VVV-X) Surveys, 
            which has been observed the Galactic bulge and disc regions during the past decade in five near-IR filters ZYJHKs and also presenting a multi-epoch campaign in K<sub>s</sub>-filter spanning from 2010 to 2015. 
            We selected red dwarf stars based on PSF photometry data and distinguished red dwarfs from red giants stars, spurious to our current analysis, making use of 
            the astrometric data provided by the VVV InfraRed Astrometric Catalogue (VIRAC) and the Gaia mission. 
            This particular type of star becomes of great interest in exoplanetary studies due to its relative low dimensions and temperatures, 
            which maximises researches on potentially habitable, water-supported rocky exoplanets orbiting such stars. 
            Subsequently, we searched for relatively small periodic photometric variations implementing a Box-fitting least-squares method 
            in order to detect and fit exoplanetary transits. Through parameters such as transit depth, width and orbital period, 
            as well as knowing the spectral subtype of the central star, besides estimating its distance, it is possible to estimate the parameters of the exoplanet, 
            as the radius, surface temperature,  and mass, also its density and surface gravity, important factors in the characterisation of a certain exoplanet as to its habitability.</p>

              <h3><b>A brief overview on exoplanetary studies</b></h3>

              Contemplating the formation of planets orbiting different stars from our Sun isn't something new and it has become unquestionable their existence nowadays. 
              Since ancient Greece, on the first speculations about <i>many bodies of all sorts and shapes moving from the infinite into a great void</i> by Leucippus (5th cn. B.C.E.; Mayers 2014), 
              to the existence of <i>infinite worlds both like and unlike this world of ours</i> by Epicurus (341-270 B.C.E.; Kragh 2014), exoplanetary studies evolved not only due to the advent
              of new technologies but also as a result of the human capacity to discover its past, associate it to the present and speculate its future. 
              The first Earth-like mass exoplanet was discovered orbiting a pulsar by Wolszczan and Frail (1992), and a few years later, the discovery of the first exoplanet orbiting a 
              main-sequence star, the <i>51 Peg b</i> by Mayor and Queloz (1995) earned the <A href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2019/summary/">2019 Nobel Prize in Physics</A> to the researches involved. In addition to these individual exoplanet detections, the first exoplanetary system discovered orbiting also a main-sequence star, the U And, was detected by Butler et al. (1999), consisting of 5 objects including the star itself.

               <br><br>

               The primary classification of a certain unknown-nature object as an exoplanet takes account into its clearly gravitational link to a star, if
               it present enough mass to assume a hydrostatic balance (&lt;13 M<sub>Jup</sub>, which is approximately the mass limit where thermonuclear fusion
               processes may occur), therefore presenting a round-shape and if its likely to <i>clear it's neighbouring region</i>. Some criteria can be used in determining the last characteristic, which includes the ability of a 
               body to scatter smaller masses out of its orbital region for a huge period of time, also known as the &Lambda;-discriminant (Stern and Levison 2002), 
               the &mu;-discriminant to separate bodies orbiting stars into planets and non-planets (Soter 2006), and also the &Pi;-discriminant, that allows us to categorise a body based only on
               its mass, semi-major axis and its central star mass (Margot 2015). 
               
               $$ \Pi = \frac{m}{M^{5/2}a^{9/8}} k \gt 1, \quad k = \sqrt{3} C^{-\frac{3}{2}} (100 t_{\odot})^{\frac{3}{4}}\frac{M_{\oplus}}{M_{\odot}} $$
               
               Unlike the other discriminant mentioned, &Pi; is totally theoretically based and does not use data from the Solar System planets in its formalism,
               making it applicable to exoplanetary systems of the most varied configurations different from ours. It is important to remark that the &mu;-discriminant requires an
               accurate census of the orbital zone and the &Pi;-discriminant is only applicable to circular orbits.

          <h3><b>M dwarf stars selection</b></h3>
          <p> 
              As they are relatively cooler and smaller compared to the Sun, red dwarf stars present strong lines of TiO, CaH, and VO 
              in their optical spectra, besides FeH and H<sub>2</sub>O molecules in their infrared spectrum (Baker 1938, Mould 1976). 
              The choice of such objects in our analysis is primarily based on the fact that their maximum emission occurs in near-infrared wavelengths, 
              observation range of the VVV Survey. 
              Since those objects present long life spans, whose energy generation is due to the <i>pp</i>-chain (<i>p</i> + <i>p</i> &rarr; <sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub>D + e<sup>+</sup> + &nu;<sub>e<sup>-</sup></sub>) 
              and given the large fraction of those present in the Galaxy, red dwarf stars become one of the main targets in the search of potentially habitable exoplanets.

              <br>

              Making use of <A href="https://vvvsurvey.org/">VVV Survey</A> (Minniti et al. 2010) multicolour data for field <i>b294</i> located towards the Milky Way bulge (1.5<sup>°</sup> x 1<sup>°</sup> centred at <i>l</i>, <i>b</i> = 3.88<sup>°</sup>, -3.14<sup>°</sup>), 
              we selected M dwarf stars in order to analyse photometric variations due to exoplanets-like objects orbiting such stars. 
              Several effects increase the likelihood of life on M dwarf planets, including their abundance in the Galaxy (&asymp;85&#37; of 100+ billion stars) and the intense cloud formation on the star-facing side of tidally locked planets, responsible to reduce the overall thermal flux and equilibrium temperature differences between two sides of a planet (Yang et al. 2013).
              
              Both giant and red dwarf stars of spectral subtype M present similar near-IR colours range, for instance in <i>(J-H)</i> and <i>(H-K<sub>s</sub>)</i>
              colours, which makes the photometric selection solely inefficient. We adopted <i>H</i><sub>J</sub> &gt; 68.9<i>(J-K<sub>s</sub>)</i> - 50.7 for M dwarf stars in order 
              to perform a better distinction between such objects making use of the astrometric data from the <A href="https://www.eso.org/sci/publications/announcements/sciann17222.html">VIRAC</A> (Smith et al. 2018), 
              calculating the reduced proper motion of selected objects according to the equation below. Moreover, from the <A href="https://sci.esa.int/web/gaia">Gaia DR2 data</A> (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2018), 
              we selected only stars with parallax measurements larger than <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration:overline">&omega;</SPAN> = <i>1</i> <i>mas</i>, especially due 
              to the relative proximity of M dwarf stars in the magnitude range of our data, which consequently present high proper motion, in contrast to red giant stars, 
              further away however reddish due to extinction effects in the Milky Way.

            Photometric variations in exoplanet-M dwarf system are relatively small, typically about 0.15<sup>m</sup> in K<sub>s</sub> filter (&lambda;<sub>Ks</sub> = 2.14 nm), 
            therefore we arbitrarily limited our selection in the VVV K<sub>s</sub>-band PSF light-curves to K<sub>s</sub> &lt; 16.5<sup>m</sup>, 
            consequently &sigma;<sub>Ks</sub> &lt 0.1<sup>m</sup>, which is expected to reduce the incidence of false positives in our analysis. 
            Furthermore, based on their near-IR colours, we estimated the spectral subtype for M dwarf class as a function of the colours <i>&Gamma; &equiv; Y-J</i>, <i>&Pi; &equiv; Y-K<sub>s</sub></i> 
            and <i></i>&Psi; &equiv; H-K<sub>s</sub></i>, following equation below, also estimated the distance of such objects making use of the observational apparent and theoretical magnitudes in J filter

            It is not surprising to say that one of the main objective of exoplanetary studies nowadays are focused on the detection and subsequent characterisation of potentially habitable
            water-supported rocky exoplanets, in other words, objects orbiting the so-called habitable zone (HZ) of its central star (Kopparapu et al. 2013). 
            Exoplanets with masses up to &approx;0.10 M&oplus; represent a potential study laboratory for the origin of organic life, however, the
            detection of minerals only found in meteorites, such as (Fe,Cr)<sub>1.15</sub>(Ti,Fe)<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> (Heideite), Na<sub>2</sub>Mg<sub>4</sub>Cr<sup>3+</sup><sub>2</sub>(Si<sub>6</sub>O<sub>18</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)
            (Krinovite) and Fe<sup>0+</sup><sub>1.5</sub>Ni<sub>0.5</sub>P (Barringerite) for instance, may indicate numerous different chemical compositions in exoplanetary systems, 
            preventing in a certain level environments conducive to the presence and maintenance of organic life (Gaidos and Selsis 2007). <br><br>

          <h3><b>The Box-fitting least squares (BLS) method</b></h3>
        <p>

            In opposition to commonly implemented <A href="https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/api/astropy.timeseries.LombScargle.html">Fourier-like sinusoidal methods</A> (e.g. Ferreira et al. 2018, Ferreira et al. 2019, VanderPlas 2018), the BLS is a statistical method developed by Kóvacs et al. (2002) in order to detect transit-like 
            candidates by potential exoplanets (even exoplanetary systems and/or exomoons) modelling a periodic upside-down box in a time-series photometric data-set 
            &Lambda;&doteq;{t<sub>k</sub>, y<sub>k</sub>, &sigma;<sub>k</sub>, k = 1,2,...,n}. Four main parameters derived from the Python implementation <i><A href="https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/timeseries/bls.html">astropy</A></i>
            used in this work are the orbital period (P<sub>orb</sub>), transit duration (&tau;), transit depth (&delta;) and a reference mid-transit time by the first event (&phi;). 
            
            The algorithm works as follow: 
            <ul>
                <li>select a period and event duration grids that best apply to the case of M dwarf stars orbited by exoplanets;</li>
                <li>apply a <i>sigma-clip</i> &sigma; = 3 cut in &Lambda;, which removes some outliers; </li>
                <li>apply a minimisation of <i>O(i<sub>1</sub>,i<sub>2</sub>)</i>, a function of the ingress and egress times, which determines the width and also the position of the <i>box</i> on a phase diagram.</li>
              </ul>

            It is noteworthy that the transit-time event <i>L</i> is relatively shorter in comparison to the quiescent magnitude of the star <i>H</i> in those systems where the central star and the exoplanet are close.
            Due to the temporal non-regularity of the variability data from the VVV Survey, we opted for ignoring limbdarkening effects at the beginning as well as at the end of the transit
            event, represented by <i>i<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>i<sub>2</sub></i> respectively. We define:

            $$ \mathcal{L} \doteq \Delta K_\mathrm{s}=\max{(\delta)\equiv\mathcal{H}-\mathcal{L}}, $$
            
            $$ \mathcal{H}\doteq \Delta K_\mathrm{s}\approx0. $$
            
            Considering an arbitrary signal optimisation interval, the residual sum of squares can be expressed according to:

            $$ \mathcal{O}(i_1,i_2) = \sum_{i=1}^{i_1 - 1}\tilde\omega_i^2(\tilde{x_i} - \mathcal{H})^2 + \sum_{i=i_1}^{i_2}\tilde\omega_i^2(\tilde{x_i} - \mathcal{L})^2 + \sum_{i = i_2 + 1}^{n}\tilde\omega_i^2(\tilde{x_i} - \mathcal{H})^2, $$
            
            $$ \tilde x_i = \left \{ \begin{matrix} \mathcal{L}, & \mbox{if }i\in[i_1,i_2] \\ \mathcal{H}, & \mbox{if }i\in[1,i_1)\cup(i_2,n]\end{matrix} \right.$$
            
            The differentiation &#x2202;<sub>(L,H)</sub><i>O</i>(i<sub>1</sub>,i<sub>2</sub>) = 0, yields to analytical expressions for the magnitude levels <i>H</i>> and <i>L</i>, 
            making use of 
            <i>&beta; </i>&equiv; &Sigma;<sub>i<sub>1</sub></sub><sup>i<sub>2</sub></sup><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration:tilde;">&omega;</SPAN><sub>i</sub><sup>2</sup> and 
            <i>&gamma; </i>&equiv; &Sigma;<sub>i<sub>1</sub></sub><sup>i<sub>2</sub></sup><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration:tilde;">&omega;</SPAN><sub>i</sub><sup>2</sup><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration:tilde;">x;</SPAN><sub>i</sub>

            $$ \mathcal{H} = -\frac{\gamma}{1-\beta} \quad \mbox{and} \quad \mathcal{L} = \frac{\gamma}{\beta}. $$ 
            
            Therefore, we can re-write the expression for the residual sum of squares according to

            $$ \mathcal{O} = \sum_{i=1}^{n}\tilde\omega_i^2\tilde x_i^2 - \frac{\gamma^2}{\beta - \beta^2}. $$

            It is remarkable to note that the third term of equation above is (i<sub>1</sub>$,i<sub>2</sub>)-independent, so we can define the Signal-Residue (&#1064;) following equation below, which can be used to characterise the quality and the significance of the signal found.

            $$ &#1064; = \max{\left[\sqrt{\frac{\gamma^2}{\beta-\beta^2}}\right]}. $$

            Furthermore, we define a Signal Detection Efficiency (SDE) criteria as function of the Signal-Residue according to Kóvacs et al. (2002):

            $$ \mbox{SDE} = \frac{\max\left({&#1064}\right)-\overline{&#1064}}{\sigma(&#1064)} $$

            897.672 stars. A total of 24.360 M dwarf stars were selected after the photometric and astrometric processes previously described. After applied a Box-fitting least-squares algorithm,
            we selected 1195 stars following: 
            <ul>
              <li> Orbital period smaller than <i>6</i> days;</li>

              <li> Since planetary transit events cause an increase in the magnitude of a given observed star, we selected stars with transit depth &delta; &gt; 0</li>
