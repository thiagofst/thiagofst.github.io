        <p><strong>Exoplanets in Old and Chemically Distinct Stellar Populations</strong></p>
        <p>One core focus of my research concerns exoplanets orbiting chemically and kinematically peculiar stellar populations, particularly thick-disc and halo stars. These systems provide unique laboratories for studying planet formation in the early Galaxy under low-metallicity and &alpha;-enhanced conditions. We investigate how planet occurrence rates, bulk compositions, and orbital architectures differ from those around younger stellar populations, and how host-star chemistry and Galactic environment influence the long-term dynamical evolution of planetary systems (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025arXiv251217072F/abstract">Ferreira &amp; Galarza, 2025; arXiv:2512.17072</a>). Related works explore warm Neptunes in the so-called Sub-Jovian desert, including prospects for atmospheric characterisation around old, low-mass stars and constraints on hydrodynamic escape processes (Ferreira &amp; Galarza, in preparation).</p>    
    
        <p><strong>Brown Dwarf Companions and Orbital Dynamics</strong></p>
        <p>A second line of research examines the orbital dynamics and demographics of transiting brown dwarf companions. In particular, we focus on their eccentricity distribution and what it reveals about their formation pathways, whether via disc fragmentation or extreme core accretion, as well as their subsequent migration histories (Ferreira &amp; Rice, in preparation). In this work, we explore correlations between eccentricity, mass, host-star properties, and orbital separation, and quantify the role of tidal interactions in shaping long-term orbital evolution, including eccentricity damping and spin-orbit realignment timescales as functions of stellar structure and age.

        <p><strong>Population III Evolution, Asteroseismology, and Remnants</strong></p>
        <p>A central focus of my PhD thesis concerns the evolution of the first stars formed in the Universe &mdash; Population III stars &mdash; and their potential remnants. Using detailed hydrodynamic stellar evolution models computed with MESA, we develop a self-consistent evolutionary framework for low-mass, zero-metallicity stars, demonstrating that non-canonical mixing and internal structural readjustments generically induce self-enrichment during advanced evolutionary phases (Ferreira et al., submitted to AAS Journals, November 2025; Paper I), and that these processes leave unambiguous asteroseismic signatures encoded in the stars' internal stratification, which provides, for the first time, a seismic pathway for identifying and characterising primordial stellar populations (Ferreira et al., submitted to AAS Journals, December 2025; Paper II). In parallel, we investigate whether the abundance patterns observed in extremely metal-poor stars reflect enrichment by core-collapse or pair-instability supernovae, and how such signatures may be detected in current or forthcoming surveys.</p>
