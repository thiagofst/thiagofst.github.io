    <h1>Research Interests</h1>

    <p><strong>Exoplanets</strong>One central focus of my research concerns exoplanets orbiting chemically and kinematically distinct stellar populations -- especially thick disc and halo stars. These systems offer a unique laboratory for studying planet formation in the early Galaxy, under low-metallicity and alpha-enhanced conditions. I am interested in how the frequency, composition, and dynamical properties of such planets differ from those orbiting thin disc stars, and what the differences reveal about the role of host star chemistry and Galactic environment in shaping planetary systems. Recent efforts have also considered the presence of warm Neptunes in the so-called "Neptune desert", including the prospects for atmospheric characterisation of planets around old, low-mass stars and constraints on hydrodynamic atmospheric escape.</p>
    <p><strong>Brown dwarfs</strong>We also study the dynamical and statistical properties of transiting brown dwarfs. A particular area of interest is the eccentricity distribution of these substellar companions, and what it reveals about their formation pathways -- whether through disc instability or core accretion -- and later on migration processes. I am exploring how this distribution correlates with companion mass, host star properties, and orbital separation. We further examine the role of tidal dissipation and angular momentum transfer, including the influence of stellar age and internal structure on eccentricity damping and spin-orbit evolution.</p>
    <p><strong>Population III Stars</strong>Another area of active research involves the first generation of stars -- Population III -- and their low-mass descendants. I use detailed stellar evolution models to explore how these zero-metallicity stars evolve, and which unique seismological signatures they may present. Additionally, I am interested in how the chemical abundance patterns of extremely metal-poor stars may preserve signatures of early nucleosynthesis events. In particular, we investigate whether core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) or pair-instability supernovae (PISNe) may have imprinted distinct abundance patterns on second-generation stars, and how these patterns might be identified in current and future astronomical surveys.</p>
