One central focus of my research concerns exoplanets orbiting chemicaly and kinematically distinct stellar populations -- especially thick disc and halo stars.
These systems serve as unique laboratory for studying planet formation in the early Galaxy, under low-metallicity and alpha-enhanced conditions. 
I am particularly interested in how the occurrence rates, bulk compositions, and orbital architectures of such planets differ from those around younger stellar populations, and what is the implication of host star chemistry and Galactic environment on planetary systems evolution. 
Recent works has also investigate warm Neptunes located in the so-called "Sub-Jovian desert", including the prospects for atmospheric characterisation of planets around old, low-mass stars and constrains on hydrodynamic escape processes. 

I have been also investigating the orbital dynamics and demographics of transiting brown dwarf companions. 
A specific focus is the eccentricity distribution of these substellar objects, and what is revealed about their origins -- whether formed via disc fragmentation or extreme core accretion -- and subsequent migration.
We examine how orbital eccentricity correlates with amss, host star properties, and separation, as well as the influence of tidal interactions with the host star in shaping long-term orbital evolution. 
This includes quantifying eccentricity damping and spin-orbit realignment timescales, and how these depend on stellar structure and age.

Another active line of research explores the lives and post-main sequence evolution of the earliest stars -- Population III -- and their remnants. 
Using detailed hydrodynamic stellar evolution models, we study how zero-metallicity stars evolve and what asteroseismic fingerprints they may leave behind. 
In parallel, we explore whether the abundance patterns in extremely metal-poor stars reflect enrichment by core-collapse or pair-instability supernovae, and how such signatures might be detected in current or future surveys.

Finally, I am activelly investigating white dwarf pollution as a window into the late-stage evolution of planetary systems. 
By studying metal-contaminated white dwarf atmospheres, we can reconstruct the composition of accreted planetary debris and gain insights into the survival and disruption of exoplanetary bodies around evolved stars. 
This work complements studies of planetary formation and migration by tracing their ultimate fates.
